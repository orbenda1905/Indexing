InfoQ - Angular and TypeScript ,26,4,2016.
AngularJS is by far the most popular JavaScript framework available today for creating web applications. And now Angular 2 and TypeScript are bringing true object oriented web development to the mainstream, in a syntax that is strikingly close to Java 8.

According to Google engineering director Brad Green, 1.3 million developers use AngularJS and 300 thousand are already using the soon to be released Angular 2. After working with Angular 2 for the last 10 months I believe its impact on the JavaScript community will rival that of the Spring framework on Java.

In this article I’ll provide a high-level overview of the Angular 2 framework.

At the end of 2014 Google announced that Angular 2 would be a complete rewrite of AngularJS, and they even created a new language “AtScript” that was meant to be used for writing Angular 2 applications.

But then Microsoft agreed to add support for decorators (a.k.a. annotations) to their TypeScript language (a strict superset of JavaScript), and so that emerged as the language for the development of the Angular 2 framework itself, and the recommended language for developing applications using the AngularJS framework.
