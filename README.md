Searching

There are few basic rules for searching:
1)The phrase must be legal logically (each opening brackets must come with closing ones).
2)The phrase must start with a word.
3)Inside brackets there must be at least two words with logical operator.
4)You must keep spacing between each part in the phrase -> W OP W ( W OP W ).
5)You can't open brackets immediately after opening brackets->logically it's not needed. wrong example: W ( ( W OP W) OP W )
